Manual steps that are still done on every new setup:

1. Run `~/.dotfiles/zero/setup`.
2. Restart once completed (and as-needed for system updates done by the script).
3. Rotate or import SSH keys.
4. Import software licenses.

Then, in no particular order:

- Set host name under System Preferences > Sharing > Computer Name.
